Sharing the [Shiny app][app] I created for completion of the course *Developing Data Products* on [Coursera][course].

I have also prepared a [pitch presentation][pitch] for the app, which gives a little overview, instructions, etc. Source code can be found [here][source].

Have fun and let me know your thoughts!
